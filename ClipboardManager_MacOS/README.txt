May 8:  GUI is now changed to menubar app. This is based on the MenuBar_CORE app. This is the core for future development... From now on, the development will be focused on adding a list box for clipboard items, file path handling and detection, selective copy and pasting, maybe file preview (like the windows version made back in 2017), content edititng (text only) and/or adding extra text to the clipboard directly... This version only supports text, clearing the clipboard and appending all...
