May 10:  There was an isue with th e # of items label where it would not correctly show the numbers; this issue is now fixed.
         An On/Off switch is added to choose the state of the manager; off means it willl no longer record clipboard data and on means it will.

May 9:  New textfield added. Now, the clipboard data is editable and also, strings can be directly written in the clipboard. However, the app still only supports text 

May 8.2:  There was an issue were clipboard data would not be recorded at start so the users had to click on the menubar icon then begin copying. This issue is now fixed. Minor bug fixes and stability
          is now improved ever so slightly.

May 8:  GUI is now changed to menubar app. This is based on the MenuBar_CORE app. This is the core for future development... From now on, the development will be focused on adding a list box for clipboard
        items, file path handling and detection, selective copy and pasting, maybe file preview (like the windows version made back in 2017), content edititng (text only) and/or adding extra text to the
        clipboard directly... This version only supports text, clearing the clipboard and appending all...
